Description

A frontend for GNU Emacs to the Music Player daemon. The interface
closely, though not strictly, resembles that of ncmpc, which I had
been using before (the main drawback of ncmpc for me was itâ€™s apparent
lack of support for unicode). It has some advantages over other
clients, mainly in the field of playlist editing. This is achieved
through marking and regions as you are used too in emacs and in
dired. Mingus also provides a point-of-insertion for inserting new
songs. This can be handy to drop a song after the currently playing
one (enqueue), but is more flexible. Mingus is distributed under the
GPL.

w3m

Another plus is its integration with emacs-w3m , in the sense that,
when bumping into a sexy podcast or radio-stream while browsing in
the browser of browsers, you have the ability to add any stream at
point (and play it directly, if so desired).

Dired

Jump from Mingus to song at point in Dired, and, vice versa, add songs
from Dired to the playlist.

Mingus stays home

If mingus stays home, i.e. the daemon mpd is run from the same
computer as the client, mingus-stays-home.el provides some tagging
support for ogg, flac and mp3, an experimental cd-burning tool
(mingus-burns).

Prerequisites

libmpdee.el by R. Ramkumar. Currently mingus runs on GNU Emacs22 and
GNU Emacs 23. If you also want to use mingus-stays-home.el, the
programs flac, metaflac, vorbiscomment, sox, id3v2 and cdrecord (or
any other command-line cd-burning tool taking files as arguments) might
be needed.
